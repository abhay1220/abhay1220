### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD Student at Texas A&M University. My research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for multi-agent collaborative path planning problems. My thesis topic is on Assisted Path Planning problems where a support agent is used to assist the primary agent in completing a given task. 

I am currently doing an internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory where I worked on solving the Multi-Agent Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with fairness constraints. I proposed a novel parametric formulation of the MTSP with Second Order Conic (SOC) constraints which can generate an optimal fair solution based on the fairness parameter set by the user. This formulation is a viable alternative to the min-max formulation to generate fair solutions with lower computation time.
